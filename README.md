# Data and code repository for *Ethnomedical specialists and supernatural theories of disease*

This repo contains data and code for reproducing our study, now published in *Review of Philosophy and Psychology*. The published paper can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13164-021-00589-8). A nicer looking and formatted pre-print version can be found [here](https://psyarxiv.com/gbamc/), and the manuscript version can be found in this repo, called `magic-healers-article2.pdf`. To reproduce the pdf in this repo, run the Rmarkdown file `magic-healers-article2.Rmd` in this directory.

All cross-cultural HRAF scripts begin with `eHRAF` and all fieldwork scripts begin with `FIELD`. The `analysis.R` script is central to the entire workflow in this directory, and all other R scripts are sourced from it. Questions, concerns, and suggestions should be directed to Aaron Lightner, at adlightner at cas dot au.dk.
